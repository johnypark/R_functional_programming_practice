## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Practice 1 starts with ...
```{r cars}
mtcars %>% group_by(cyl)%>%nest()
```

And the final product is...

```{r cars}
groupby_mtcars %>% 
  mutate(
    
    model=data%>%map(trait_model,"wt","mpg")
    
    
    
  )
```

Practice 2 starts with ...
```{r cars}
mtcars %>%data.table
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
